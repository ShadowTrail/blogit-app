          Blogger's Stop may review your conduct and content for compliance with
          these Terms and our Rules, and reserves the right to remove any
          violating content. Blogger's Stop reserves the right to delete or

          rights of others, and to terminate accounts of repeat infringers. We
          respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement if they comply

          You retain your rights to any content you submit, post or display on
          or through the Services.{" "}
        </p>{" "}
        <p>
          Unless otherwise agreed in writing, by submitting, posting, or
          displaying content on or through the Services, you grant Blogger's
          Stop a nonexclusive, royalty-free, worldwide, fully paid, and
          sublicensable license to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish,
          translate, create derivative works from, distribute, publicly perform
          and display your content and any name, username or likeness provided
          in connection with your content in all media formats and distribution
          methods now known or later developed on the Services.
        </p>{" "}
        <p>
          {" "}
          Blogger's Stop needs this license because you own your content and
          Blogger's Stop therefore can’t display it across its various surfaces
          (i.e., mobile, web) without your permission.
        </p>{" "}
        <p>
          {" "}
          This type of license also is needed to distribute your content across
          our Services. For example, you post a story on Blogger's Stop. It is
          reproduced as versions on both our website and app, and distributed to
          multiple places within Blogger's Stop, such as the homepage or reading
          lists. A modification might be that we show a snippet of your work
          (and not the full post) in a preview, with attribution to you. A
          derivative work might be a list of top authors or quotes on Blogger's
          Stop that uses portions of your content, again with full attribution.
          This license applies to our Services only, and does not grant us any
          permissions outside of our Services.

          {" "}
          So long as you comply with these Terms, Blogger's Stop gives you a
          limited, personal, non-exclusive, and non-assignable license to access

          Stop trademarks, logos or other brand features.
